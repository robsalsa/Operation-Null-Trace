                    Honestly, I don't really have nor had one... BUT!1!!
                </p>
                <p> Uhh.. no, nevermind. I really didn't have one. I kinda just started and didn't stop.
                    Although, I will admit it all started as a design idea that I had while making an actual website.
                </p>
                <p>It pretty funny to me because the site I was working on was pretty calm and quite but then you see
                    this site and yeah, lol.</p>
                <p> Anyways this (image under here) was my plan for this site. Yeahhh... I made it the day before. </p>
