                    Honestly, I don't really have nor had one... BUT!1!!
                </p>
                <p> Uhh.. no, nevermind. I really didn't have one. I kinda just started and didn't stop.
                    Although, I will admit it all started as a design idea that I had while making an actual website.
                </p>
                <p>It pretty funny to me because the site I was working on was pretty calm and quite but then you see
                    this site and yeah, lol.</p>
                <p> Anyways this (image under here) was my plan for this site. Yeahhh... I made it the day before. </p>

                    Its cool that theres people that even take the time to look into a strangers "amature geocities"
                    site, lol.
                </p>
                <p> i fixed somethings mainly being the header (the one on this page) and the sizing issues for smaller
                    screens. Hopefully its better put together. Funny enough media quaries were pretty easy to wrap my
                    head around. </p>

                    Although I enjoy drawing and doodling i rather continue CS tbh
                </p>
                <p>At the bottom are all the images and pngs that I used that are drawn by me. They took kinda long to make but at the same time they were super fun to make. Also all assets were their own thing that I used for drastically different things just a coincidence that all are some animal... and most are frogs. Anyways they're cool you should check them out :)</p>
